We decided that the way we would make Apple Picker better is to increase the difficulty of the game. We found the game to be way to easy, and it gets boring after a while. 
So our game gets increasly harder for each 10 apples that are dropped. The speed and chance to change directions of the tree increases, and the seconds between apple drops
decreases for each 10 apples dropped. We also made the game a little easier in the beginning to compromise. The game seems way to easy in the beginning but quickly you will find out that
the tree starts moving faster and dropping apples at a quicker rate. When the player loses a basket we reset the apple tree back to default settings so that the player can prepare
for the increased difficulty.
